As oil companies sink more resources into dangerous practices like hydraulic fracturing and prospecting in extreme environments at the Earthâ€™s poles, more and more people are looking for a way out of their own oil dependency. Photovoltaic panels and wind turbines are growing more sophisticated as the pace of research ramps up, but these energy sources are still much more expensive for an individual or household to implement, so convincing people to switch is difficult. These sites have the latest data on renewable energy technologies, availability, and the environmental impact of using a renewable source instead of rapidly dwindling supplies of combustible fossil fuels.',
